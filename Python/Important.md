## Python Most Important Concepts 

1. Udemy course concepts mention to cover python in details

2. Python used in ML, AI, Web-development 
3. Python is a high-level intrepreted, General purpose programming language etc. Python supports objects, modules, threads, exception-handling, automatic memory management etc. 

4. Dynamic Type language: type of objects is checked during the execution of a program. 

5. Python is intrepreted / Compile language :   .py --> bytecode --> .pyc file and then find out the values. Bytecode can be executed on any platform. 

6. C++ --> Human readable code --> Machine Code --> executable file --> Run by CPU.

7. What is Garbage Collection: Automatically free the space of unused variable in the memory for you.

8. Python programs are both compiled as well as intrepreted!! But the compilations part is hidden from the programs.

9. PEP8 : Provides the guidelines for the python developers for styling the code. 

10. What is mutable vs Immutable objects: 
    - Mutable datatype --> list, dictionary, set, user-defined data types. 
    - Immutable datatype --> int, float, decimal, bool, string, tuple, range, 

11. list vs tuple ? 
```python
    # list 
    numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    # tuple you can't change the values because it is immutable 
    numbers = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
```
